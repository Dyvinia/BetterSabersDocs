# Setup & Installation

## Plugin Installation
1. Download the latest version of [BetterSabers](https://www.nexusmods.com/starwarsbattlefront22017/mods/16?tab=files)

2. Open the `.zip` file and drag `BetterSabersPlugin.dll` Into the `Plugins` Folder

## Using the Plugin

1. Launch the Mod Manager ([latest](https://github.com/CadeEvs/FrostyToolsuite/releases)) and press the `Tools` menu at the top and click `BetterSabers`

2. Select individual presets on the left and/or select an auto select on the bottom right.

3. Configure the other settings to your desire
    - `Name` will change the name of the generated mod
    - `Trail Length` changes the length of the saber trails (motion blur)
        - The optimal value is dependent on your monitor's refresh rate, but is mostly up to personal preference
        - Shorter trails/lower values look better with higher refresh rate monitors due to the saber moving less per frame
            - `0.5` is optimal for 60hz displays
            - `0.33` is optimal for 144hz displays
            - `1.0` is the default value in the game set by DICE
    - `Show Advanced Options` shows options that may be not relevent to most users
        - `Light Intensity` changes the overall intensity of light emitted onto the surrounding world

    - `Auto Select Presets` will automatically select the appropriate color for the sabers on the list on the left based on the auto select pack selected in the dropdown below

    - Found inside the Plugins folder where `BetterSabersPlugin.dll` was installed
